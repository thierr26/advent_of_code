This repository contains solutions in
[Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)) to some [Advent
of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

For each solution, there is a `run` Linux shell script that you can run to
build and run the Ada program. The script uses [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/)
to build and run the Ada program.
